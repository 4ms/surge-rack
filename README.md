# Surge in Rack (experimental)

This repo holds an experimental set of code which aims to break apart the surge synth at
https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/ into distinct rack modules for the oscillator,
filter, effect, and waveshaper block segments. Maybe one day the LFOs also.

It is mac only so far, and doesn't work at all. This repo exists on github just so
@baconpaul can start tracking his todo list with github issues and use github branches.

Oh for now I'm building this with rack v1 not rack v0.62. If I get it working way earlier than
a rack 1 release date I'll do the back port.
